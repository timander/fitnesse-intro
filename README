Thanks for trying out the fitnesse-intro!


 -bin           convenience shell scripts
 -disc-golf     application code and test code
 -fitnesse      FitNesse server
 -README        this file


You may need to install the fitnesse and fitlibrary
artifacts manually because they are new and not in
the Maven2 central repository yet.  There is a script
in the bin directory for your convenience.
